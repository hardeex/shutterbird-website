<center><h3>ABOUT SHUTTERBIRD'S AMBASSADOR</h3></center>
                    <p>Welcome to Shutterbird's Ambassador Villa. We are pleased to have you here, and we hope you have been enjoying our brand. Our brand ambassadors are also our representatives and advertisers. So, to be our brand ambassador you must be willing to support and promote our noble brand to the world, using all promotional media, even through words and actions. You are going to be our company's identity, representing Shutterbird brand any day, any time, talking about the brand online and offline.
The following article explains who our ambassadors are, what advantages they offer and how our company can benefit from advocates in recruiting.
</p>
<center><h3>WHO IS OUR BRAND AMBASSADOR?</h3></center>
<p>Our brand ambassador is a person who is ever ready to represent our brand in a positive light, helping to increase brand awareness and sales. They act as the embodiment of the company's corporate identity through words, demeanor, values and ethics. Our Brand ambassadors are experts when it comes to talking about the brand online and offline.
</p>
<center><h3>WHAT DOES OUR BRAND AMBASSADOR DO?</h3></center>
<p>The key element of our brand ambassadors is their ability to use promotional strategies that will strengthen the customer-product-service  relationship and influence a large audience to buy and consume more. Our brand ambassadors can be found on various channels such as blogs and personal websites, as well as social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn. Social media has become an effective medium in recent years. Our Brand ambassadors should be able to make full use of these channels to further promote the Shutterbird brand.
</p>

<center><h3>WHAT CAN OUR BRAND AMBASSADORS DO FOR SHUTTERBIRD?</h3></center>
<p>1).They consolidate the Marketing and Recruiting team:
With a brand ambassador, our company has an additional member of the marketing and sales team. Word of the mouth is one of the most effective forms of advertising. By giving positive reviews, our brand ambassadors can change the public's perception of the Shutterbird brand.
</p>
<p>2).They contribute to the brand 's social presence:
Most of our ambassadors have already established themselves online as public figures and have built solid online reputations. This means they already have loyal followers and an extensive social network. For this reason, they are also referred to as influencers as they can reach a large number of people with just one tweet, status update or blog post. Our website can also benefit. Thanks to their solid online reputation, our brand ambassadors can easily drive traffic to the company's website.
</p>
<p>3).They give the brand a human touch:
A brand in itself is nothing more than a name or image. Which is why customers are more likely to identify with brands which have a face to represent them. Using professional models for promotion doesn't automatically entice customers to Shutterbird brand. Our advocates, on the the other hand are to make the brand human and tangible.
</p>
<p>4).They offer what customers are looking for; Honesty:
Our brand ambassadors should promote the Shutterbird brand because they really like it and respect the work done by the brand. Our company finds it a real morale booster when we are advertised honestly.
</p>
<p>5).They serve as a form of customer support:
A lot of customers are unsure about trying a new brand they don't already know, and tend to ask a lot of questions before deciding to try it out. Consequently, they look to bloggers and other influencers for answers. This is where our advocates come in, to help answer these important questions.
</p>
<p>6).They aid in expanding the market:
With the help of our brand ambassadors, new markets can be opened up. For example, if a shoe company in Peru wants to attract the attention of customers in Canada, it can reach them with the help of a Canadian blogger.
</p>
<h3>HOW IMPORTANT ARE OUR FANS TO THE SHUTTERBIRD BRAND?</h3>
<p>Our fans are very important to the growth and consistency of the Shutterbird brand. Through our fans, our brand is communicated a wide variety of people, which results in engagement towards the brand. Of course, every well meaning brand needs a dependable and relentless fan base to push the brand higher up the marketplace. This is the reason why our brand fans are very committed to the brand, and this commitment in turn translates into the greatest lifetime value of all our customers. A recent study shows that businesses successful in creating brand fans grow some 2.5 times faster than their competitors who don't.
</p>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>Our Brand ambassadors are also our authentic brand pronouns. Potential customers often trust human referrals more than conventional advertisements. And since ambassadors occupy a specialist position, the trust of potential customers is even greater and that is why we want you to be our brand ambassador today.</p>
